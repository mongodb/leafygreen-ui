'@leafygreen-ui/menu': minor

- Adds `onOpen` and `onClose` callback props to the Menu. These are fired when the popover enter/exit transition (respectively) is completed.

- Exports `MenuContext` from package. This is useful for testing custom `MenuItem` components without rendering a full popover menu
