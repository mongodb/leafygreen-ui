[LG-5608](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/LG-5608)

In v20, the `initialFocus` prop was prematurely removed without proper migration paths. This change restores the prop with enhanced functionality and control. See more on [initial focus behavior](https://github.com/mongodb/leafygreen-ui/tree/main/packages/modal#initial-focus-behavior).
