'@leafygreen-ui/tokens': patch
---
Updates icon color tokens in both light and dark modes to improve visual consistency and accessibility.

Dark Mode (darkModeColors.ts)
Updated the InversePrimary variant's default icon color from white to black to match the hover state, ensuring visual consistency across interaction states.

Light Mode (lightModeColors.ts)
Updated the Disabled variant icon colors from gray.base to gray.light1 across all interaction states (Default, Hover, Focus). This provides a lighter disabled appearance that better distinguishes disabled icons from active ones.
