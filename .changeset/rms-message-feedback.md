[LG-5575](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/LG-5575)

- Added compatibility with `@lg-chat/leafygreen-chat-provider@6.0.0`. We recommend new projects use `@lg-chat/leafygreen-chat-provider` v6; support for v5 will be removed in a future major version.
- Removed `PopoverMessageFeedback` component and `PopoverMessageFeedbackProps` type exports.
