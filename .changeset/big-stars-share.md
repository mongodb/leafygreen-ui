'@leafygreen-ui/toggle': patch

Updates `data-lgid` and `data-testid` to use scope based test IDs. These test IDs are generated using the helper utility `getLgIds`. For more information [check out the section in the styleguide about getLgIds](https://github.com/mongodb/leafygreen-ui/blob/main/STYLEGUIDE.md#getlgids).
