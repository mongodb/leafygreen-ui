[LG-5360](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/LG-5360): add `variant` prop to `LeafyGreenChatProvider` which can be used to determine the visual variant of chat components
  - `compact`: A dense, smaller variant ideal for use in constrained spaces within product UIs like a drawer or side panel.
  - `spacious`: A larger, more expressive variant with bigger fonts and more white space, designed for marketing pages or standalone popovers.
