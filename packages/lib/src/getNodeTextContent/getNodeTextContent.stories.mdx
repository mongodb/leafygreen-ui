## getNodeTextContent

`getNodeTextContent` returns the text contents if its `children` node. If there are multiple nodes passed in its `children`, it will recursively retrieve the text content of all nodes, and return a string of all text content separated by spaces. 

It is mainly used in conjunction with CSS pseudo-elements to ensure that components with `active` props don't change in width when their content's style props like font-weight change.


#### How it should be used

```
  import { getNodeTextContent } from '@leafygreen-ui/lib';

  export const titleTextStyle = css`
  
    #test-div {
      font-weight: 600;

      &.active {
        font-weight: 700;
      }

      &:after {
        content: attr(data-text);
        visibility: hidden;
        font-weight: 700;
      }
    }

  return (
    <div id="test-div" data-text={getNodeTextContent(children)}>
      ...
    </div
  )
```

If the above component hadn't used `getNodeTextContent`, the `#test-div` element's width would have changed when the `active` class was applied.
