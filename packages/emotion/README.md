```

# LeafyGreen Internal Emotion Instance

This package should be used _only_ in LeafyGreen components (i.e. `@leafygreen-ui/*` packages).

For external applications, prefer using `@emotion/react` (or similar), or an app-specific [custom instance](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/css#custom-instances) of Emotion.

> **Why?** If _any_ `@leafygreen-ui/*` dependencies are not up to date, this could cause multiple copies of `@leafygreen-ui/emotion` to be installed, resulting in unpredictable styling.

## Server-side Rendering

Because we use a custom instance of Emotion to allow for styles defined in LeafyGreen to be easily overwritten, there's an additional step that must be taken to use our components when performing server-side rendering.

We expose three methods as named exports that are also exposed by the base `emotion-server` package: `renderStylesToString`, `renderStylesToNodeStream`, and `extractCritical`. You can find documentation on usage of each of the methods in the [official Emotion documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr#api-reference).

> **NOTE:** If you are already server-side rendering an application using Emotion, you will use the methods exposed in `@leafygreen-ui/emotion` instead of, NOT in addition to the methods exposed by `emotion-server`.

### Example

```js
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import { renderStylesToString } from '@leafygreen-ui/emotion';
import App from './App';

const html = renderStylesToString(renderToString(<App />));
```
