### Common Issues

##### My new prop isn't showing up in Storybook controls

Ensure that the new prop is also defined in the component's prop types. If the component is using `forwardRef`, also refer to this known [issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9511) in Storybook.

##### My prop's control is showing up, but not the notes from TSDocs.
