### Common Issues

##### My new prop isn't showing up in Storybook controls

Ensure that the new prop is also defined in the component's prop types. If the component is using `forwardRef`, also refer to this known [issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9511) in Storybook.

##### My prop's control is showing up, but not the notes from TSDocs.

Ensure that the prop is defined in the component's prop types.

### Issues in Dependencies

- [Props table won't be generated for TypeScript types if forwardRef used with the default export](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9511)

Refer to the [Controls Addon docs](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-controls) for additional resources.
