<Meta title="Developer Guide/Package Folder Structure" />

### Folder Structure

- `index.tsx`
- `styles.ts`
- `types.ts`
- `<ComponentName>.tsx`
- `<ComponentName>.spec.tsx**`
- `<ComponentName>.stories.tsx**`
- `any subcomponent directories`

***only if the stories or tests pertain specifically to the component in this directory; meaning it may not be necessary for many internal subcomponents*

The folder structure should be identical for all components - whether they are considered components that are exported to npm, or subcomponents contained within those packages. In other words, **all subcomponents are simply components**, and they should be structured identically to reflect that.

### Subcomponentization

When considering whether to break some logic / style into a subcomponent, consider -

- Does it involve logic in its style or function that is independent of what the current layer of componentization should concern?

If done correctly, every layer of componentization should only need two large categories of styles - a base set of styles, and a different set of styles for every style-determining variant prop of this component (e.g. `Variant`, `Size`, etc).

Subcomponentizing correctly should mean that all rendered React components or elements are contained inside the final `return ( <>{...}</> )`.
There should not be a need for direct function calls inside the render function as any logic specific to a block of rendering should be broken out into a separate component. In other words, prefer `return ( <><Subcomponent />{...more JSX></>)` to `return ( <>{renderSubcomponent()}<...more JSX></> )`.

### FAQ

###### Why an `index.tsx` for subcomponents?

Having an `index.tsx` file for single component directories can be considered clutter. However, this would mean our import statements for this subcomponent would have to be `@leafygreen-ui/<package-name>/<SubcomponentName>/<SubcomponentName>`. Our alternative would be to place our component logic in an `index.tsx` file, but that would break our pattern of standardizing across all component directories.

This approach would also be more future-proof in case we decide to allow developers to import our subcomponents directly; all exports from the subcomponents would already be controlled through the `index.tsx` file in each directory.

###### Why `*.stories.tsx` over `*.story.tsx`?

`*.stories.tsx` is the standard [preferred](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) by Storybook. While DS has used `*.story.tsx` in the past, we should standardize to match the latest pattern moving forward.
