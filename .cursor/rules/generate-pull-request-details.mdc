Act as an expert software engineer preparing a pull request. Your task is to generate a PR title and a detailed PR description based on my currently staged git changes.

First, follow these instructions to generate the **PR Title**:
- The final title must be in the format: `[JIRA-ID] type(scope): concise summary of the main change`.
- To find the `JIRA-ID`, inspect the content of any changed files located in the `.changeset/` directory. Extract the Jira ticket code (e.g., `LG-1337`). If you find multiple ticket codes, separate them with a `|` character (e.g., `[LG-1337|LG-4567]`). If no ticket code is found, omit the `[JIRA-ID]` portion entirely.
- The `type` (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`) must follow the Conventional Commits standard based on the most significant change you analyze.
- The `scope` should be the most relevant area or component affected (e.g., `button`, `api`, `auth`).
- The summary should be a concise, lowercase description of the main change.

Next, use the following template **exactly** to generate the **PR Description**.

**IMPORTANT CHECKLIST LOGIC:** You must choose **only one** of the two checklists provided below. To decide which one to use, analyze the file paths in the staged git changes.
- If you detect that a **net-new directory** has been created directly under `packages/`, `tools/`, `chat/`, or `charts/`, then you **must** use the "For new components" checklist.
- Otherwise, use the "For bug fixes, new features & breaking changes" checklist.

Do not include both checklists in your final output.
